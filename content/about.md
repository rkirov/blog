Hello! I am Rado Kirov. I work in front-end engineering, currently at Stripe maintaining [stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js) and previous on front-end infrastructure at Google including - Angular, TypeScript and the
Closure Compiler. In the past, I have tried to be a professional mathematician,
but left academia after a one year stint as a postdoc.
