Hello! I'm Rado Kirov, a front-end engineer at Stripe where I maintain [stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js). Before this, I worked at Google on front-end infrastructure, helping build core technologies like Angular, TypeScript tooling, and the Closure Compiler. I started my career in academia as a mathematician, completing a postdoc before transitioning to software engineering.
